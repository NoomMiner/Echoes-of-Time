# System Description
The problem of dissatisfaction with the stress and tedium of everyday life affects people who enjoy exploring other worlds and solving novel puzzles, the impact of which is people suffering boredom when they lack a meaningful avenue of escapism.
For gamers who enjoy experiencing virtual stories, The Echoes of Time is an adventure game that provides a brief escape from reality into a new virtual world; unlike other adventure games, which avid adventure game consumers may have played before, our product is a story about time which they have yet to experience.
Echoes of Time is an adventure game that helps gamers who like puzzles and storytelling relax and exercise their puzzle-solving skills, exploring themes of time and unforeseen consequences alongside modern issues like environmentalism.

Echoes of Time aims to entertain gamers who enjoy casual adventure games, puzzles, and fun storytelling. Our player base of casual gamers who enjoy indie puzzle adventure games is merely responsible for giving our game a chance. Our system must be consistent with this goal, providing simple and easy-to-understand mechanics, appealing art assets, and an environment for the players to explore and enjoy. Echoes of Time is set in a fictional world of dragons and monsters, a world where traveling across time exists and is accessible to the player. Interacting with this world is one of the highlights of this game, really helping to get a feel for the world and the fictional people that live in the small town we explore within. We also hope to expand this experience through a musical soundtrack. 

We will incorporate various aspects of this world so as many people can enjoy it as possible. We will keep it portable, so any player can play the game at any point. We intend to maintain and update the game as it develops. We will design controls that remain smooth regardless of the device used to play.
