# Tests
The testing framework used was GUT (Godot Unit Testing). The test scripts can be viewed [Here](../EchoesofTimeGodot/test/unit).
## Example test
- Class Tested: [player.tscn](../EchoesofTimeGodot/player.tscn)
- Script: [test_movement.gd](../EchoesofTimeGodot/test/unit/test_movement.gd) <br>

This test ensured that the correct velocity was applied to the character depending on the direction pressed.

# Technology

# Deployment
- [Link to itch.io](https://noomminer.itch.io/echoes-of-time) <br>
We have decided to deplot the product on the independent game development platform itch.io. We chose itch.io because it is a very popular platform for inde game developers who are looking to get a start. We will deploy by creating a page for the project on itch.io and uploading an executable.
