### 1\. Positioning

#### **Problem statement**

The problem of dissatisfaction with the stress and tedium of everyday life affects people who enjoy exploring other worlds and solving novel puzzles, the impact of which is people suffering boredom when they lack a meaningful avenue of escapism.

#### **Product Position Statement**

For adventure gamers and people who enjoy a variety of games who attain fulfillment in life through vicariously experiencing virtual stories, The Echoes of Time is an adventure game that gives them a brief escape from reality into a new virtual world; unlike other adventure games, which avid adventure game consumers may have played before, our product is a story about time which they have yet to experience.

#### **Value proposition and customer segment**

**Value Proposition:** Echoes of Time is an adventure game that helps gamers who like puzzles and storytelling relax and exercise their puzzle-solving skills, exploring themes of time and unforeseen consequences alongside modern issues like environmentalism.

**Customer Segment:** Gamers who enjoy adventure games and storytelling

### 2\. Stakeholders

**Users (Casual Gamers)** \- people who like adventure games and trying out new games. Want entertainment. Responsible for giving the game a chance/playing it.

**Software Developers** \- members of the dev team who have some experience coding, and want a product to turn in and show to prospective employers. Responsible for implementing the mechanics of the game on GoDot and ensuring that assets load smoothly.

**Art Team** \- members of the dev team who like/do art. Responsible for fleshing out the story of the game, developing art assets, and finding appropriate sound assets.

**Test Users** \- people who are willing to try out the game while it is being developed. Responsible for play-testing the game and giving honest feedback.

**Professor** \- Dr. Palmer, professor of the course. Responsible for equipping dev team with the skills needed to collaborate effectively and encouraging consistent progress with graded assignments. 

### 3\. Functional requirements (features)

Make a numbered list of requirements for your software. Just self-explanatory titles are enough at this point. Remember that requirements should deliver the value proposition and they must be consistent with the interviews you performed for the previous deliverable. You can talk again to your clients to help define the requirements. While writing the requirements, focus on the capabilities needed and not on how they should be implemented.

*Grading criteria (2 points):* The list should be comprehensive (remember that you are not expected to implement all the requirements by the end of the course but you should list them). Follow the same pattern to describe all the requirements. The list of requirements should be coherent with the previous sections.

### 4\. Non-functional requirements

Make a numbered list of non-functional requirements that are important for your software. Explain their importance. Follow the terminology of ISO/IEC 25010:2011. For each non-functional requirement, give an objective goal/measurement in order to provide verifiability for the requirement. You can find more details at the following URL:  
[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8559686 Links to an external site.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8559686)

*Grading criteria (2 points):* Follow the ISO-IEC terminology, explain why they are important, provide verifiability criteria for each requirement.

1. Portable \- important because ….  
   1. Playable on Windows  
   2. Playable on Linux (Ubuntu/Linux Mint)  
2. 

### 5\. Minimum Viable Product

What will be your MVP? Which features are you going to validate? How?

*Grading criteria (2 points):* Describe what would be considered the Minimal Viable Product and how it will be tested (e.g., via implementation, prototyping, Wizard of Woz, etc.). Make clear what you are going to validate. The MVP should be coherent with the previous sections.

### 6\. Use cases

Include a UML use case diagram for your project. There are many drawing tools that you can use.  I recommend the one we used in class, draw.io.

Grading criteria (5 points): Follow correctly the UML specification. The actors should be coherent with what was listed in sections 1 and 2\. The use case diagram should be coherent with the list of requirements (section 3). The level of granularity of each use case should be adequate. The use cases should be adequately named.

Present one complete use case description (textual) for each member of the group. Therefore, if the group has 4 members, 4 use case descriptions are necessary. As the grading will not be individual, the group is responsible for keeping the quality and consistency of the whole document – avoid just splitting the work. Choose the most important use cases to describe. Follow the template provided in the slides.

After each use case description, add a sketch of the corresponding user interface. This will be a good opportunity to start thinking about usability. 

*Grading criteria (8 points):* Follow the template to describe the use cases. Present an interface sketch for each use case. Describe the use case as a dialog between the user and the system. Do not use UI language in the description of the use case.
#### Use Case \#1:
##### Solve Puzzle
- Actor: Player
- Trigger: Player's progression is halted
- Preconditions: Player is in game
- Postcondition: Player progesses
##### Success Senario:
- Player's progress is stopped (e.g locked door)
- Player interacts with puzzle elements
- Player discovers solution
- Player implements solution
### 7\. User stories

Write two user stories for each member of the group. They can be related to the same features described in the use cases or to different ones. Adopt the following format: "As a \<ROLE\>, I want \<SOMETHING\> so that \<GOAL\>." 

Establish a priority level for each user story and estimate how many hours each one will demand using the planning poker approach. 

(1) As an adventure enthusiast, I want multiple possible endings so that I feel like I have agency in the story.

Priority: 7/10		Hours Estimate: 20

(2) As a puzzle enjoyer, I want challenging puzzles so that I feel accomplished after playing.  
	Priority: 4/10		Hours Estimate: 5

(3) As a casual gamer, I want simple, clear mechanics so that I can play without frustration.  
	Priority: 8/10		Hours Estimate: 10

(4) As a cybersecurity nerd, I want open-source software so that I can personally confirm the privacy and security of the game.  
	Priority: 6/10		Hours Estimate: 2

(5) As someone who likes art, I want stylistic graphics so that I can feel more immersed in the story.

	Priority: 7/10		Hours Estimate: ??

(6)

(8) 

*Grading criteria (6 points):* Use the provided format. The user stories should be in an adequate level of granularity (not too broad nor too specific). Provide the priority and estimation for each user story.

### 8\. Issue Tracker

The user stories should be registered in your GitHub issue tracker. Include here the link for your issue tracker and a screenshot of what you did. 

*Grading criteria (1 point):* Provide the URL and screenshot of the issue tracker. The user stories should be registered there.

### Format

Your document should be composed in Markdown and hosted on GitHub but you should also turn in a PDF copy to be graded.  See also [Converting GitHub Markdown to PDF](https://canvas.nau.edu/courses/35867/pages/reading-converting-github-markdown-to-pdf).  Sections should use appropriate markdown and figures should be included if needed or appropriate.

### Teamwork

I will review your repository for commits.  If I find that there are individual members of the team that do not significantly contribute (number of commits, meaningful contributions to each section, etc.), I will deduct points from that individual's grade proportionally.  Also note that even documentation should demonstrate proper pull request etiquette and best practices\!
