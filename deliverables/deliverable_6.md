# Introduction
For gamers who enjoy experiencing virtual stories, the adventure game Echoes of Time provides a brief escape from reality into a new virtual world. Echoes of Time has value in its novelty, giving players the opportunity to experience its story for the first time--unlike other open-source adventure games, which many avid adventure gamers have already played before. The current system, which is implemented in GoDot with the graphical user interface and GDScript, includes a moveable player character in a top-down world implemented with tilesets, three interactive objects (a 'weird clock', a door, and a cake), two rooms that the player can move between, and a simple puzzle. With this we're using the stylistic assets developed by our artist, Wil.

# Requirements
List in this section, the requirements and associated pull request that you implemented for this release, following the example below---include the description of the requirement, a link to the issue,  a link to the pull request(s) that implement the requirement, who implemented the requirement, who approved it, and a print screen that depicts the implemented feature (if applicable). Order the requirements by the name of the student who implemented them.

We expect that you implement/prototype the features you specified in your MVP (c.f. D.2 Requirements). We expect that all the members of the group have been involved in some programming activities and report here several pull requests. 

Example:

Requirement: As a Student, I want to add a homework assignment so that I can organize my ToDo list.
Issue: <link to your GitHub issue>
Pull request: https://github.com/user/project/pull/426
Implemented by: Martin Fowler
Approved by: Ada Lovelace
Print screen: A print screen that depicts the implemented feature (if applicable)

Remember that all source code should be submitted by means of pull requests and t#he quality assurance person in the team should review and approve each pull request. For more information about pull requests:
https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests  

Grading criteria (20 points): This section will be evaluated in terms of correctness, completeness, thoroughness, consistency, coherence, adequate use of language, and amount of work put into the implementation. Students can receive different grades depending on their involvement. It is expected that all members contribute with non-trivial implementation. All pull requests should be approved and integrated by the quality assurance person. You should follow an adequate workflow (description of the requirement on the issue tracker, submission of the implemented requirement as a pull request, and review of the pull request by another developer). 

# Tests
You should implement automated tests for the features described in the previous subsection. Provide the following information:

Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.)
Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.
An example of a test case. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.
A print screen showing the result of the automated tests execution. 
Grading criteria (3 points): You should have an adequate number of automated tests. They should be well written and match the features implemented in the aforementioned pull requests.

Demo
Include a link to a video showing the system working.

Grading criteria (10 points): This section will be graded based on the quality of the video and on the evidence that the features are running as expected. Additional criteria are the relevance of the demonstrated functionalities, the correctness of the functionalities, and quality of the developed system from the external point of view (user interface).

# Code quality
### 1\. Version Control
  We used git for version control with our repository hosted on GitHub
### 2\. Collaboration
Each team member worked on a separate branch for new features, fulfilling any open issues
### 3\. Modular code
Created scripts that could be used in multiple places throughout the project. For example, interact script used for doors, items, and speaking with NPCâ€™s
### 4\. Code testing and debugging
We created test scenes/scripts to verify and isolate specific components before implementing them fully.
### 5\. Communication
Communication is key for this project, we have set up our own private team workspace on Discord where we share ideas and help each other implement new features


# Lessons Learned
In retrospect, describe what your team learned during this second release and what would you change if you would continue developing the project. 

Grading criteria (2 points): Adequate reflection about problems and solutions, clear description with adequate use of language.
